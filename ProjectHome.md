# Overview #

**The project has been moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/ombre42/jrobotremoteserver) with a new maintainer. Please go there for latest and future releases, bug fixes, and support. That said, I have decided to keep the old source code, Java binary, descriptions, and wiki documentation available on this site for reference and for those that have a use for the old release, code, or want to use Redstone XML-RPC server with the remote server. The rest of the overview below applies to the old release only (not what's on GitHub).**

This project offers a generic remote server for [Robot Framework](http://www.robotframework.org), implemented in Java, for use in creating remote libraries. It can alternatively be used for other purposes outside of [Robot Framework](http://www.robotframework.org). Remote server requires the [Redstone XML-RPC library](http://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/) for Java.

Please read RemoteServerDetails page for installation, usage, and details about the remote library server.
