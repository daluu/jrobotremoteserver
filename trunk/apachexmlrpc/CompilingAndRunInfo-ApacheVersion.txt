/* NOTE: 

Recommended that you go to https://github.com/ombre42/jrobotremoteserver to get the latest release that uses Apache XML-RPC. Otherwise, read on...

The info here is given as reference for how to compile & use Apache XML-RPC with
the old remote server code in this repository instead of Redstone XML-RPC. Whatever new changes in Redstone branch that may apply to Apache as well can be manually backported by the user as needed. What is available in this branch is enough as a starting base on how to build the server with this version of XML-RPC library.
