This project has been superceded with new maintainers: https://github.com/robotframework/jrobotremoteserver

Please go there for latest and future releases, bug fixes, and support. That said, I have decided to keep the old source code, Java binary, descriptions, and wiki documentation available on this site for reference and for those that have a use for the old release, code, or want to use Redstone XML-RPC server with the remote server. The rest of the overview below applies to the old release only.

This project offers a generic remote server for Robot Framework, implemented in Java, for use in creating remote libraries. It can alternatively be used for other purposes outside of Robot Framework. Remote server requires the Redstone XML-RPC library for Java.
